## � Core Competencies & Capabilities

- 👁️‍🗨️ **Transcendental Face Recognition** — Real-time, high-accuracy face detection and identification using OpenCV and KNN.
- 📝 **Automated Attendance Logging** — Instant CSV-based attendance with precise timestamps.
- 🧠 **Rapid Face Enrollment** — Effortless face capture and labeling for new users.
- 🔒 **Proxy & Fraud Prevention** — Only live, real faces are accepted—no spoofing with photos or videos.
- 📊 **Privacy-First Data Handling** — All biometric data is stored locally, never in the cloud.
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Cross-Platform** — Runs on most laptops with a webcam (Windows, Linux, Mac).

## 🛠️ Requirements

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Dependencies-OpenCV%20%7C%20scikit--learn%20%7C%20numpy-blue"/>

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---


## 🚦 Quick Start

1. **Enroll Faces:**
   - Run `main_capture.py` and follow the prompts to capture and label faces.
2. **Mark Attendance:**
   - Run `recognize_and_mark_attendance.py`.
   - Press `o` to mark attendance, `q` to quit.
3. **Review Logs:**
   - Attendance CSVs are auto-saved in the `Attendance/` folder.

---

## 🔬 How It Works: Pipeline Flow

1. **Face Enrollment:**
   - Capture and label faces using your webcam.
2. **Model Training:**
   - Faces are encoded and stored with names for fast lookup.
3. **Recognition & Logging:**
   - The system recognizes faces in real time and logs attendance with timestamps.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `main_capture.py` — Face capture & training
- `recognize_and_mark_attendance.py` — Recognition & attendance
- `background.png` — UI background
- `Attendance/` — Attendance logs
- `data/` — Models, cascade, and face data
